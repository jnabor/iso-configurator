# isometric-configurator
A prototype/poc of isometric configurator using stack images with transparency

## Notes:
* Each configuration has a corresponding layer in the stacked images.
* All images are required to have exact size, with the fixtures placed at the area where it would appear in the final image.
* For this prototype, the images are rendered in Revit 2023 Trial version, with the lowest quality render setting.
* Light source is placed at exactly the same point at the camera to prevent showing shadows.
* PNG images are converted to WebP using GIMP.
